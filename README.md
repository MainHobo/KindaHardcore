# Kinda Hardcore

This is a spigot plugin for servers that want a **kind** of *hardcore*, a hardcore without permadeath

It basically just teleports you a random place when you die, which makes it more of a hassle to get your stuff back.

## Commands

### /khctoggle <username>
  To toggle the random spawn on death for a user

### /khcreload
  To reload the plugin after updating the config file
